Hi everyone! I am IglKa. 
I am 15 years old boy from Russia who only started learning how to programm.
I intersted in SoftWare/Web-Development on Python.
I am trying to get an experience from everything, that's why I am looking for a vacation or people that I can talk with.
I am not looking for a high salary(doesn't mean I don't need it). I love programming not for wage, but because my soul like it.
Also I am learning English, doing sport and I am a good friend and boyfriend :)

You can contact me with my email - superigorek74@gmail.com

I would be happy if you would contact me. :)
